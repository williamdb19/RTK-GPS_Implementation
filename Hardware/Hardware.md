# Rover Hardware
This document is used to show how the hardware is setup on the rover module. Based on your use case, you can follow some of our steps when implementing the RTK-GPS system into your project.

## Rover Chassis
<p align>
The rover chassis was already built and setup when we first got onto the project. We were able to find the rover chassis from <a href = https://www.generationrobots.com/en/401506-wild-thumper-6x6-chassis-with-75-1-motors.html> this website </a>. Specs of the rover, dimensions, and motor specifications are in the website.
