# RTK-GPS_Implementation
A repository that hosts information for the RTK-GPS Implementation project.

# Project Info
This project is from our Senior Design Project at Mercer University. We were tasked with...
1. Developing a high-accuracy GPS system
2. Implementing it into a [common use case](README.md#Use_Case)
3. Documenting the process for open-source use on how to possibly implement it into your project
